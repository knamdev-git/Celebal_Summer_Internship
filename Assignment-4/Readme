Assignment 4 :

Question 1-> 
============
Basic commands of docker : 
  1. docker images - to see the images in docker
  2. docker pull - to pull any image from system or docker hub
  3. dokcer run <image-name> - it means to run the image and in this the container generated automatically
  4. exit : to stop using container anymore.
  5. docker ps -a : to list all container created or exited.
  6. docker ps - to see the running container
  7. docker start <container_name or id> : to start the container.
  8. docker stop <container> - to stop the container.
  9. docker rm <container_Name or id> - to remove the container.
  10. docker rmi <img_name or if> - to remove the image.
  11. docker network ls - to list all the network.

Question 2->
===========
Build Docker Image from Dockerfile

  Create custom image using a Dockerfile
  cmd : sudo docker run hello-world

Question 3->
===========
Docker Registry, DockerHub, Multi-Stage Builds
  -> Registry: Image storage system
  -> DockerHub: Public Docker registry
  -> Multi-Stage Build: Reduces image size and separates build steps
Commands : `docker login`, `docker build`, `docker push`

Question 4->
===========
Create Docker Image from Running Container

You can create an image from a modified or running container using `docker commit`.
Useful for saving the state of a container as a reusable image.
Command:
  `docker commit <container_id> myimage:v1`

Question 5->
============
Push & Pull Image to DockerHub or ACR

Push uploads your image to DockerHub or Azure Container Registry (ACR).
Pull downloads an image from the registry to your local system.
Commands:
  `docker tag myimage username/myimage`
  `docker push username/myimage`
  `docker pull username/myimage`

Question 6 -> 
==========
Create a Custom Docker Bridge Network

Custom bridge network allows containers to communicate with each other using container names.
Helps in organizing multi-container applications with better control.
Command:
  `docker network create my-network`
